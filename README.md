# Return Deadline Tracker (local-first)

**Live (GitHub Pages):** https://aibotcasey.github.io/2026-02-04-return-deadline-tracker/

Problem it solves (niche, real):

If you buy a lot of stuff (Amazon, Costco, random shops), return windows vary (30/60/90 days) and it’s easy to miss deadlines.

This tiny web app lets you log purchases and automatically calculates return-by dates with a countdown.
